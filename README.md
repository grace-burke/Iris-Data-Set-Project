## Fisher’s Iris Data Set

### History of Data
British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher
1936
Ref: The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems
Data collected by Edgar Anderson to quantify morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species
Collected in Gaspé Peninsula, Quebec, Canada
Ref: The Species Problem in Iris
Typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines

### Description of Data
50 samples each of 3 different Iris species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor)
Length & width of sepal and petal (cm)

### Analyses of Data
#### Fisher
Multivariate – Observation and analysis of more than one outcome variable
Example of linear discriminant analysis – Pattern recognition to find a linear combination of features that characterises classes of objects. Used to distinguish Iris species from each other by features.
